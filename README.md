Source code of [Reve Island](https://www.roblox.com/games/9481429677).

Reve Island is a RPG Roblox game.

It has been developed in Lua using the Roblox Studio game engine.

This game is a roleplay game where each player can choose to play from many jobs (fisherman, farmer, lumberjack, miner...). The game also has multiple popular features (global leaderboards, pets...)

The game has a low poly/cartoony visual style which is pretty appealing (with bright colors and simple geometry) while improving performance (less polygones to render). 


# Status

The project has reached a stable state but is not being actively developed anymore.


# Project

I worked on this as a side project for about 3 years. I learnt Lua by myself by studying other games and models.

As a solo developer on the project, I had to work on all aspects of the game: coding, UI designing, 3D modeling, testing, fixing bugs... which allowed me to learn and improve a lot.

I then worked on another project in Lua which you can find [here](https://github.com/Quentin-Chauvelon/Zombie_Invasion_Survive).

I think the idea of the game was good (another very similar game that launched roughly at the same time went on to become the most popular game on Roblox). However, for a first project, it was way too ambitious and I lacked experience, I still persevered and, aftr 3 years, managed to finish the game, which made me learn a lot.
